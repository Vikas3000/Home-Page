				<p class="text-big">The Renewable Energy </p>
				<p class="text-small">Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are
					replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such
					sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around
					us. Fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are non-renewable resources that take
					hundreds of millions of years to form. Fossil fuels, when burned to produce energy, cause harmful
					greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide.

					Generating renewable energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Transitioning
					from fossil fuels, which currently account for the lion's share of emissions, to renewable energy is
					key to addressing the climate crisis.

				<p class="text-small">Renewable resources include solar energy, wind, falling water, the
					heat of the earth (geothermal), plant materials (biomass), waves, ocean currents, temperature
					differences in the oceans and the energy of the tides.Local governments can lead by example by
					generating energy on-site, purchasing green power, or purchasing renewable energy. Using a
					combination of renewable energy options can help meet local government goals especially in some
					regions where availability and quality of renewable resources vary.

				<p class="text-big">Why renewable resources are important? </p>
				<p class="text-small">Generating energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions from
					fossil fuels and reduces some types of air pollution. Diversifying energy supply and reducing
					dependence on imported fuels. Creating economic development and jobs in manufacturing, installation,
					and moreLike any human activity, all energy sources have an impact on our environment. Renewable
					energy is no exception to the rule, and each source has its own trade-offs. However, the advantages
					over the devastating impacts of fossil fuels are undeniable: from the reduction of water and land
					use, less air and water pollution, less wildlife and habitat loss, to no or lower greenhouse gas
					emissions
